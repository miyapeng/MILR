  "enhanced_text": " A photo of three pizzas, each with a different topping. The pizzas are placed on a wooden table, with a pizza cutter and a plate nearby. The pizzas are of different colors, with one being red, one being yellow, and one being green. The toppings are varied, with one pizza having pepperoni, another having mushrooms, and the third having olives. The pizzas have different shapes, with one being a round circle, another being a square, and the third being a triangle. The texture of the pizzas is smooth, with a slight sheen from the cheese. The wooden table has a rustic appearance, with visible grain and knots. The pizza cutter is metallic, with a shiny surface, and the plate is white, with a simple design. The pizzas are placed close to each other, with some space between them.",
